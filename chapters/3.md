# Chapter 3: Editing your tweak

Let's get your tweak opened in a text editor, and set everything up before we go into the workings of Logos and Objective-C. Below I am opening the folder in VSCode using ```CMD + O```. It should look something like this.

![vscode-1](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/vscode-1.png)

The latest versions of Theos create a file called Tweak.x, but I prefer to rename it to Tweak.xm so I can use MobileSubstrate functions such as ```MSHookIvar```, which is a powerful way of modifying iOS and will be explained in great detail later on. 

Tweak.xm is the main file that you will be editing. This is where all the code for tweak is placed. In order for your tweak to build however, there are a few more steps that must be taken. Open your Makefile in the editor, and change it following the code below.

### Before

```
INSTALL_TARGET_PROCESSES = SpringBoard

include $(THEOS)/makefiles/common.mk

TWEAK_NAME = testtweak

testtweak_FILES = Tweak.x
testtweak_CFLAGS = -fobjc-arc

include $(THEOS_MAKE_PATH)/tweak.mk
```

### After

```
ARCHS = arm64 arm64e

include $(THEOS)/makefiles/common.mk

TWEAK_NAME = testtweak

testtweak_FILES = Tweak.xm
testtweak_CFLAGS = -fobjc-arc

include $(THEOS_MAKE_PATH)/tweak.mk

after-install::
	install.exec "sbreload"
```

I like to remove the ```INSTALL_TARGET_PROCESSES = SpringBoard``` from my Makefiles as I use an older method that allows for more customization. This is why we add ```after-install::
	install.exec "sbreload"```. This is what is run after the tweak is finished installing. Many tweaks use ```killall -9 SpringBoard``` to respring, but I prefer ```sbreload``` as it is usually much quicker.
	
At the top where you see the line ```ARCHS = , arm64 arm64e``` this is where we specify the architectures that the tweak will be built for. Since this guide is based on iOS 13, I will only be using ```arm64``` and ```arm64e```, but should work for tweaks built for iOS 7 and higher, and support iPhone 5s - iPhone X. These are important as iPhone XS and newer have a different architecture for the A12 and A13 chipsets, so make sure to include ```arm64e```

Next we will set up the IP address of your device in the Makefile. This will allow us to run the command ```install``` or ```make do```. To get the address of your device, go to Settings > Wi-Fi > Tap on the ⓘ next to your Wi-Fi network and note the numbers next to IP Address. For me, it is ```192.168.1.4```. Add this to your Makefile at the top like this: 

```
THEOS_DEVICE_IP = 192.168.1.4

ARCHS = arm64 arm64e

include $(THEOS)/makefiles/common.mk

TWEAK_NAME = testtweak

testtweak_FILES = Tweak.xm
testtweak_CFLAGS = -fobjc-arc

include $(THEOS_MAKE_PATH)/tweak.mk

after-install::
	install.exec "sbreload"
```

When using Makefile, words that are capitalized are variables. These can be referenced by using a ```$(VARIABLE_NAME)```.
